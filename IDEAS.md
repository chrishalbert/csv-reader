# TODO List:

- If item in table looks like link, add '<a>' tag
- If there is a title line, have option to transform data into array of objects, JSON style, and export
- Detect separator, not hard coded or required from form
- If page tries to download .csv, open them in the browser window anyway
- Search for the '<pre></pre>' tags and get only the text inside, will help in pages like Wikipedia, git.devacademy.ro, etc.

# Ideas:

- Will be able to order by column, hide columns by click on top maybe, maybe search or filter?
