# TODO List:
- 

# Ideas:
- Detect separator, not hard coded or required from form
- If page tries to download .csv, open them in the browser window anyway
- Decide if separator is a select list, or if check it before using it in the fn
- Will be able to order by column, hide columns by click on top maybe, maybe search or filter?
- While it is processing the content, hide it already and add a spinning something or an emoji
