# What is this?

This Extension will transform raw .csv data into a simple html table, and show it online in the same tab.

This way you don't need to download any file and deal with opening it in Numbers, Excel, etc., nor try to go through the data in its raw state.

# Features:

- Detects if it's a .csv page
- Input the separator, if there is a title line, and lines to skip on top: it will transform the raw data to a table
- Format the table nicely so it's easy to read
