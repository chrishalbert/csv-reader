# CSV Reader

üöß Work in Progress... üöß

## What is this?

A Firefox extension.

It will transform raw `csv` data into a simple `html` table, and show it online in the same tab.

### What problem does this solve?

When quickly looking through csv data files online, you either have to:

- Open them with Excel, Numbers, etc.
- Try to skim through the data in its raw state.

_CSV Reader_ allows you to look at the data formatted as a table, so you can make decisions faster.

## Features

CSV Reader detects if the current tab is a `.csv` page (correctly most of the time).

Allows user to input some settings:

- Separator (defaults to `,`).
- Title line option (defaults to `false`). If checked, first line of csv will be the table header.
- Number of lines to skip on top (defaults to `0`). Useful if data has additional info on top.
- Check for links option (defaults to `false`). If checked, links in data will be clickable.

It transforms the raw `csv` data into a table, nicely formatted so it's easy to scan (see images below).

## How to use

1. In Firefox, head to [the extension page](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/csv-reader/) and install it. (Sorry, Chrome extension coming soon).
2. Head to any `.csv` data page.
3. Click on the extension icon, fill the form:
   1. Choose the _separator_.
   2. Check if there is a title row for the data. This will format a header row in the table.
   3. Input the number of lines to skip on top. csv pages have a few lines with info at the top, we don't want to format those.
4. Done, enjoy the table!

### Example

Visit [this csv sample dataset](https://rubenvara.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/csv/dataNov-2-2020.csv).

Click on the CSV Reader extension icon.

In the popup, input `|` (pipe) as the separator, and check the title line option:

Click "Convert":

To go back to the raw data, click the "Reset" button on the extension popup:

## Some kind of roadmap...

Some features I'd like to work on (help appreciated):

- [x] Chrome version.
- [x] Improve the browser icons (dark/light, design).
- [x] Style the table row on hover.
- [ ] Show progress: while the content is being processed, hide it and show a loading component.
- [x] If separator is also in text, between `""`, detect and don't use as separator.
- [ ] Add an initial check to see if content is _too big_. If it is, change the parse method to a lighter one.
- [x] Add `<a>` tags to links if they are links (regex) and the config option is checked in the popup.
- [ ] Detect if text _looks like a link_.
- [x] Update README and Firefox page with images and examples of usage.
- [ ] Try to auto-detect separator.
- [x] Add some useful data in the result page (number of rows and columns, etc.).
- [x] Ask users in the result page to leave a 5‚≠ê review please.
- [x] Remove `""` from the strings if they are at begining and end of string.
- [x] 'Doesn't work here' message: add 'if you feel this is an error please report it'.
- [ ] Try to stop .csv files from downloading, and instead open them in browser so thay can be converted.
- [ ] Make columns hideable.
- [ ] Maybe add the `reset` button at the top of the table instead of having to open the popup again.
- [ ] If there is a title line, add option to transform data into JSON and export.
